The Goal of the homework was to build a search engine over the "best books ever" list of GoodReads. Unless differently specified, all the functions must be implemented from scratch.


## File Descriptions
The repository contains this file:
1. `ADM3_Q1.ipynb`:

          >It contains the code used for collecting data
          
2.  `ADM-HW3-Group6.zip`:

          > It contains the python notebook with the runned cells and the relative outputs for Q2 to Q5
          We had to zip it because the notebook was 29Mb so we couldn't upload it without zipping it.(The maximum was 25Mb)
3.  `Screenshots`:

          > A folder with screenshots of our notebook that we could not upload without zipping it
